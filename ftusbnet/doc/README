        Usage
=============================================================================

First start the USB-over-Network Server:

  $ sudo /path/to/ftusbnetd

Normally, the server starts in a non-debug mode and is not daemonized.  In this
mode you can stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C in your terminal window. 

To start server in daemon mode use '-d' option.  You will normally need this
option in shell scripts (e.g. if you'd like to start the server every time on
system boot). To learn how to run the server automatically on system start
please refer to your Linux distribution manual.

Daemon management can be done with a configuration file (for persistent changes)
or via the command line utility.

        Command Line Utility
=============================================================================

Run the command line utility:

  $ /path/to/ftusbnetctl <command> [options]

To see the list of all supported commands, run:

  $ /path/to/ftusbnetctl help

To see the list of the devices available:

  $ /path/to/ftusbnetctl list 
  ID         VID: PID: REV           Location  Device name and status 
  107        07d1:3c03:0001               1-2  802.11 bg WLAN /Shared/ 
  202        046d:c045:2730               2-1  USB Optical Mouse /Unshared/

Here the columns are:

  ID - unique device identifier 
  VID:PID:REV - device hardware identifier (vendor ID, product ID, revision)
	Location - USB device topology (can be "unknown" if your system cannot report
             the device topology)
	Device name and status  - displays the name of the device and its current
	           status (shared/unshared/occupied)

You can share the device by its unique ID (an example below shows how to share
USB Optical Mouse from the list above):

  $ /path/to/ftusbnetctl share 202

NOTE: Sharing by the device ID allows you to share separately one of the
devices that have identical VID:PID:REV.

To unshare the device use "unshare" command with the same syntax as "share":

  $ /path/to/ftusbnetctl unshare 202


=============================================================================
        Configuration File
=============================================================================

By default the 'ftusbnetd' daemon looks for the configuration file at
'/etc/ftusbnet.conf'. Alternatively, you can specify a custom location with
'-c' option:

  $ sudo /path/to/ftusbnetd -c /path/to/ftusbnet.conf

See the configuration file usage details in the default configuration file
"ftusbnet.conf" that is included in the product package.


=============================================================================
        Converting Trial to Full Version
=============================================================================

By default "ftusbnetd" daemon searches for the license key in the following
file "/etc/license.key". You should create this file and paste your license
key in it (including the "BEGIN" and "END" lines). Alternatively, you can
specify a custom location of the license key file with the help of '-k'
option:

  $ sudo /path/to/ftusbnetd -k /path/to/license.key.file
